This is a programming assignment I did for CSDS 364: Computational Perception. The focus of the assignment was writing more complex functions, learning to use vector operations, and making more complex plots. I wrote the code in Python within a Jupyter notebook, and I used libraries such as Matplotlib and NumPy.
